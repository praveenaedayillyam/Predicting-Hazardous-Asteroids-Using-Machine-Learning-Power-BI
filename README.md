# 🚀 Predicting Hazardous Asteroids Using Machine Learning & Power BI 🌍✨
## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the fascinating domain of space science and asteroid analysis by leveraging Machine Learning and Data Visualization techniques. Using NASA’s JPL Asteroid Dataset, the goal is to accurately predict whether an asteroid is hazardous and uncover meaningful insights through Power BI dashboards.

The project combines data preprocessing, ML modeling, and interactive analytics to understand asteroid characteristics and their potential threat to Earth.

## 🎯 Objectives

Predict hazardous vs non-hazardous asteroids

Handle large-scale and highly imbalanced data

Identify the best-performing ML model

Visualize asteroid trends and patterns using Power BI

## 📂 Dataset

Source: NASA JPL Asteroid Dataset

Size: 932,000+ records

Nature: Highly imbalanced (hazardous asteroids are rare)

Features: Orbital parameters, size estimates, velocity, distance metrics, and more

## 🔍 What Was Done
- ✅ Data Preprocessing

Removed irrelevant and redundant features

Handled missing values

Feature scaling and normalization

Addressed class imbalance during model evaluation

- ✅ Machine Learning Models Used

Random Forest

XGBoost

Gradient Boosting

These models were chosen for their robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships and imbalanced datasets.

## 🏆 Best Model Performance

Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model

Delivered higher precision and recall, making it more reliable for identifying hazardous asteroids

Suitable for real-world risk-sensitive prediction tasks

## 📊 Power BI Analysis & Insights

Power BI dashboards were created to explore asteroid data visually and extract insights such as:

Distribution of hazardous vs non-hazardous asteroids

Key physical and orbital characteristics linked to hazard classification

Patterns and trends in asteroid occurrences

Comparative analysis across different asteroid features

These visualizations helped bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
